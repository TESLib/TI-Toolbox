Several limitations warrant consideration when interpreting our findings. First, our simulations employed isotropic conductivity values and did not leverage diffusion-derived anisotropy which could influence field exposure. However, there is not enough evidence that an anisotropic approach is necessary for targeting gray matter ROIs (56). Future research should systematically investigate the impact of white matter anisotropy on TI field distributions, particularly for deep brain targets where current paths traverse extensive white matter tracts. Additionally, developing population-averaged anisotropic conductivity templates could provide a practical middle ground between computational efficiency and biophysical accuracy, especially for studies lacking subject-specific DTI data.

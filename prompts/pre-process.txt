look at this project. I want to create another tool that is similar to the simulator and flex-search.

1. the entry point is placed at the base level and is named pre-process.sh
2. the specific tools are placed one level down under pre-process/

I need the tools to do the following:


Prompt the user for what tool they want to use:

1. structural
2. dwi2dti
3. net registraiton

Prompt the user to choose subjects to use:

If the user choose 

structural:

run the following command:

dcm2niix <folder path>

if it is compress (i.e. .tgz) uncompress

dcm2nii <dir path> â†’ output is saved within the <dir path>.      (output is .nii + .json

move .nii to the appropriate location and rename file.  Keep .json inside dicom dir.

prompting:

subject

T1 / T1 + T2

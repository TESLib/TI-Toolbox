Results
For the analysis, we investigated the amplitude of the low frequency envelope of tTIS (calculated as explained in “Electric field simulations”), in contrast to the amplitude of tACS. Note that the electric fields of the tTIS montages have a different distribution and strength for the total electric field itself, resulting from both electrode pairs oscillating at slightly different high frequencies. However, the focus of the current study is to compare the electric field of the envelope frequency of tTIS across subjects, and against tACS.

ROI: left hippocampus
The electric fields for both brain stimulation methods, tTIS and tACS, targeting the left hippocampus on the MNI brain are visualized in Fig. 2a. Overall, tTIS and tACS induce similar mean electric field strength (difference of 0.01 V/m), as well as to similar maxima of the electric field inside the left Hippocampus (difference of 0.03 V/m). However, tACS results in a higher maximum of the electric field outside the left hippocampus (difference of 0.1 V/m). For tACS, approx. 15% more of the voxels inside the left hippocampus, as well as for the whole gray matter volume, are exposed to electric field strengths of greater than 0.1 V/m (see Table 1, left Hippocampus).

For tTIS, the electric field simulations targeting the left hippocampus are visualized for two representative subjects in Fig. 2b. The electric fields of the individual brains correlate with a mean of r = 0.85 (std = 0.01, median = 0.84, 75th percentile = 0.86, 25th percentile = 0.83, minimum = 0.83, maximum = 0.87, outliers = 0) with the predicted electric field on the MNI brain. The averaged correlation between individual simulation results in r = 0.85 (std = 0.01, median = 0.85, 75th percentile = 0.86, 25th percentile = 0.82, minimum = 0.77, maximum = 0.9, outliers = 2). The individual correlation coefficients are displayed in Fig. 2b.

The values for single subjects (mean electric fields inside left hippocampus and maxima of electric fields inside/outside left hippocampus, proportion of voxel that exposed to field strength greater than 0.1 V/m inside the ROI, as well as for the whole gray matter volume) are visualized in Fig. 2c. Overall, similar patterns are shown for the individual brains as for the MNI brain. However, while also in the same direction, the difference of voxels that expose to field strength greater than 0.1 V/m inside the left hippocampus is approx. 25% between tTIS and tACS (see Table 2, left hippocampus).

ROI: left motor area
The electric fields for both stimulation methods, tTIS and tACS, targeting the left motor area on the MNI brain are visualized in Fig. 3a. Overall, the results are in line with the results for the left hippocampus: similar mean- and maxima of the electric fields inside the left motor area, as well as higher percentage of voxels that expose to field strength greater than 0.1 V/m inside the left motor area, and for the whole gray matter volume for tACS. However, while also in the same direction, the difference of voxels that expose to field strength greater than 0.1 V/m inside the left motor area is nearly 50% between tTIS and tACS. The maximum of the electric field inside the left motor area is similar for both tTIS and tACS (difference of 0.02 V/m).

For tTIS, the electric field simulations targeting the left motor area are visualized for two representative subjects in Fig. 3b. The electric fields of the individual brains correlate with a mean of r = 0.94 (std = 0.01, median = 0.94, 75th percentile = 0.94, 25th percentile = 0.93, minimum = 0.92, maximum = 0.95, outliers = 0) with the predicted electric field on the MNI brain. The mean correlation across all subjects is r = 0.93 (std = 0.002, median = 0.92, 75th percentile = 0.93, 25th percentile = 0.92, minimum = 0.88, maximum = 0.94, outliers = 6). The individual correlation coefficients are displayed in Fig. 3b.

The values for single subjects (mean electric fields inside left motor area and maxima of electric fields inside/outside left motor area, proportion of voxel that exposed to field strength greater than 0.1 V/m inside the ROI, as well as for the whole gray matter) are visualized in Fig. 3c.

Overall, similar patterns are shown for both ROIs (left hippocampus and left motor area) regarding the parameter characterizing the electric field distribution and strength, when comparing tTIS with tACS: tACS resulted in only slightly stronger, or the same mean electric fields inside ROIs compared to tTIS, and only slightly higher, or the same maximal electric field inside the ROIs. However, tACS led to higher maximal electric field outside the ROI (see Table 2, left motor area).

ROI: thalamus
The electric fields for both stimulation methods, tTIS and tACS, targeting thalamus on the MNI brain are visualized in Fig. 4a. Overall, the results are in line with the patterns shown for the left hippocampus and the left motor area. However, only 1.22% of the voxel of the whole gray matter volume expose to a field strength greater than 0.1 V/m for tTIS. In contrast, 32.1% of the voxel of the whole gray matter volume expose to a field strength greater than 0.1 V/m for tACS (see Table 1, thalamus).

The electric field simulations targeting the thalamus are visualized for two representative subjects in Fig. 4b. For tTIS, the electric fields of the individual brains correlate with a mean of r = 0.77 (std = 0.03, median = 0.78, 75th percentile = 0.79, 25th percentile = 0.77, minimum = 0.67, maximum = 0.82, outliers = 2) with the predicted electric field of the MNI brain. The mean correlation across all subjects is r = 0.79 (std = 0.01, median = 0.79, 75th percentile = 0.81, 25th percentile = 0.76, minimum = 0.57, maximum = 0.84, outliers = 13). The individual correlation coefficients are displayed in Fig. 4b.

The values for single subjects are visualized in Fig. 4c (mean electric fields inside thalamus and maxima of electric fields inside/outside thalamus, proportion of voxel that exposed to field strength greater than 0.1 V/m inside the ROI, as well as for the whole gray matter).

Overall, similar patterns are shown for all ROIs (left hippocampus, left motor area and thalamus) regarding the parameter characterizing the electric field distribution and strength. However, similar to the results on the MNI brain for the thalamus: only 1.68% (std = 1.99) of the voxel of the whole gray matter volume expose to a field strength greater than 0.1 V/m for tTIS. In contrast, 39.53% (std = 18.62) of the voxel of the whole gray matter volume expose to a field strength greater than 0.1 V/m for tACS (see Table 2, thalamus).

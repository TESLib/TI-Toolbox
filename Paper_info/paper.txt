## 1. Introduction
Temporal interference (TI) stimulation has emerged as a promising technique for non-invasive neuromodulation, offering the potential to selectively target deep brain structures without surgical intervention (1). Unlike conventional transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) methods that predominantly affect superficial cortical regions, TI employs multiple pairs of high-frequency carriers with an offset frequency to create focal stimulation at depth through interference patterns (2). This approach addresses a fundamental limitation in non-invasive brain stimulation: the trade-off between stimulation depth and spatial focality. 
The principle underlying TI stimulation involves the application of kilohertz-frequency currents through multiple electrode pairs, typically using frequencies in the kilohertz band such as 2.0 kHz and 2.01 kHz, which generate an amplitude-modulated envelope at their physiologically relevant offset frequency (10 Hz in this example) (3). The dominating working hypothesis in the field says that while neurons cannot directly follow kilohertz oscillations due to their slower membrane time constants, they can respond to the interference through various proposed mechanisms including envelope demodulation, linear integration and neuronal mixing (4–6). Though the field is conflicted regarding the true mechanistic explanation, recent preclinical studies have demonstrated successful modulation of hippocampal activity and motor cortex functions (7,8) while emerging human studies report effects on working memory and epileptic biomarkers (9,10).


The mechanisms underlying TI stimulation remain an active area of research, with several hypotheses proposed at the cellular level, including the envelope demodulation hypothesis (5),the linear integration hypothesis (6), and the signal mixing hypothesis (4). While researchers are working through the fine details of the mechanism at the microscopic level, modulation of the central nervous system by TI critically depends on the electric field strength and likely the direction experienced by neural tissue in line with more traditional TES interventions (11,12). Therefore, knowing the electric field exposure is essential for planning rigorous clinical studies. Some studies take advantage of depth electrodes for cohorts that went through surgical implementation due to condition management requirements, which allows field distribution to be assessed directly through the sensors and tuned towards the desired target (10,13). However, most human studies involve subjects with no such embedded electrodes hindering the possibility of directly assessing the exposure of the brain to the TI stimulation. 
Therefore, in-silico simulations offer a powerful, non-invasive solution to this dilemma which enables researchers to estimate field exposure across the entire head with high spatial resolution, under controlled and reproducible conditions. These simulations are well-suited for conducting experimental manipulations, configuring stimulation protocols, and minimizing possible risk to participants (14). In practice, however, existing solutions remain fragmented, often requiring researchers to assemble custom pipelines, or proving inaccessible due to steep learning curves or prohibitive licensing costs. This fragmentation poses significant challenges for establishing standardized workflows and hinders the broader clinical application of in-silico TI modeling.
Here, we present TI-Toolbox, an open-source solution that provides a comprehensive platform that addresses these challenges by providing an integrated, end-to-end solution for TI research. The platform combines established neuroimaging tools within a unified framework specifically designed for TI applications, offering automated workflows from raw MRI data through optimized stimulation protocols and detailed field analysis. TI-Toolbox aims to democratize access to advanced TI modeling by unifying preprocessing, optimization, simulation, analysis and visualization within a single framework that promotes computational ease of use, reproducibility, and methodological standardization across the research community.


Using TI-Toolbox (v2.0.5) we sought to answer multiple concerns that the field has long been debating: (Q1) Does mapping optimized montages from an unconstrained genetic solution onto standard high-density EEG (HD-EEG) nets alter electric field characteristics compared to free genetic optimization? (Q2) How does using individualized head models versus a generalized model influence TI optimization performance? (Q3) Can demographic or anatomical factors explain variability in TI exposure? To answer these questions, we evaluated three ROIs: the left insula, the right hippocampus, and a spherical ROI centered at MNI coordinates (36.10, 14.14, 0.33) with radius 5 mm, while assessing the vector field of the maximal modulation field intensity and direction. 


## 2. Methods
### 2.1 Overview 
The TI-Toolbox is organized into four main components: preprocessing, optimization, simulation, and analysis. The modules are designed to operate in a linear sequence, with standardized data structures and outputs enabling reproducibility across stages. The preprocessing module generates subject-specific head models from raw MRI data via automated DICOM conversion, surface reconstruction, and finite element meshing. The optimization module determines effective electrode configurations fitted to the subject anatomy and a stimulation objective, supporting both genetic and exhaustive algorithms. The simulation module computes subject-specific electric fields and TI envelopes, with support for directional field components, multi-polar TI, and customizable electrode configurations. The analysis module extracts region-wise metrics and generates visualizations through either surface (mesh) or volumetric (voxel) evaluation pipelines, with outputs viewable in Gmsh (15) (mesh) and Freeview (16)  (voxel), and with optional cohort-level exports in MNI space.
Each component is accessible through both a command line interface (CLI) and a PyQt5-based graphical user interface (GUI). Containerization via Docker (17) ensures reproducibility (18) and simple orchestration of external dependencies across operating systems.
### 2.2 Prerequisites: 
To utilize TI-Toolbox, users must provide high-resolution anatomical MRI data in DICOM format, with at least a T1-weighted sequence required for structural processing. The inclusion of T2-weighted images is recommended to improve tissue segmentation accuracy, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data may be supplied for the computation of directional conductivity tensors for running anisotropic simulations. 
The platform is compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems via Docker-based containers running Ubuntu. Docker (or Docker Desktop) is the only required local installation; all other dependencies are encapsulated within the container environment. 
Access to the graphical user interface requires X11 forwarding or an equivalent display server across all operating systems. For standard usage, a minimum of 32 GB RAM is recommended. Installation instructions and a detailed usage guide are available in the project's GitHub repository.
Once prerequisites are installed, the correct BIDS formatting should be provided for the rest of the tools to work properly. Specifically, the user needs to set up their `sourcedata` sub-directory with either raw DICOMs or NIfTI files. The rest of the required files are generated automatically as the users moves through the toolbox (see fig3 panel AC).

### 2.3 Core Components and Implementation
#### 2.3.1 Preprocessing Pipeline
The preprocessing module orchestrates a comprehensive workflow that transforms raw MRI data into simulation-ready head models through three primary stages: DICOM conversion, cortical reconstruction, and finite element method (FEM) creation.
The pipeline begins with DICOM to NIfTI conversion which is performed using dcm2niix (19) with automatic SeriesDescription extraction from the metadata for meaningful file naming. This ensures that resulting NIfTI files retain clinically relevant identifiers from the original acquisition.
Structural processing leverages FreeSurfer's `recon-all` pipeline (16) through the `recon-all` function, which performs comprehensive cortical reconstruction including tissue segmentation, surface extraction, and automatic parcellation using standard atlases. The implementation supports both serial and parallel execution modes, with the parallel mode utilizing `GNU Parallel` (Ole, 2018) for efficient multi-subject processing.
Head model generation employs SimNIBS's `charm` function (20) for creating detailed FEMs. When both T1 and T2 images are available, charm utilizes multi-modal information for improved tissue segmentation accuracy. However, the system handles T1-only scenarios as well. As part of `charm` command, multiple 10:10 and high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) nets are co-registered with the head model via non-linear transformation from Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) to subject space. All processing steps incorporate comprehensive error handling and generate timestamped logs.
Following FEM creation, a dedicated bone analysis tool (`pre-process/bone_analyzer.py`) estimates cortical bone morphology, producing subject-level metrics including cortical bone volume and mean skull thickness. The module derives a skull mask from the head model, computes volumetric measures, and estimates thickness using distance-transform-based profiling. These metrics are exported alongside preprocessing reports and serve as covariates for downstream association analyses (Section 2.6.5).


#### #### 2.3.2 Optimization Algorithms
The optimization module implements two complementary approaches addressing the unique challenges of multi-electrode, multi-objective optimization in TI stimulation:
**Flex-Search Algorithm (`flex-search/flex-search.py`):** Built upon SimNIBS's `TesFlexOptimization` class (21), this module implements an adaptive genetic algorithm. Flex-Search iteratively evolves electrode configurations by simulating montages, evaluating the resulting electric field in a specified ROI based on a user-defined goal (mean, max, focality), and mutating to improve solutions over generations. The core implementation centers around the `build_optimization()` function, which configures optimization parameters including goal selection (mean field, maximum field, or focality), post-processing options (max_TI, dir_TI_normal, or dir_TI_tangential), and electrode configurations. To mitigate local optima, the tool supports a multi-start strategy in which the optimizer is launched multiple times with distinct seeds; users can specify the number of runs and automatically retain the best montage across starts.
The algorithm supports three distinct ROI definition methods through helper functions. The `_roi_spherical()` function enables definition of spherical ROIs with customizable center coordinates and radius, ideal for targeting specific anatomical landmarks. The `_roi_atlas()` function interfaces with cortical atlases (Desikan-Killiany, Destrieux, HCP-MMP1) (22–24) to target specific cortical regions by label. The `_roi_subcortical()` function extends targeting capabilities to volumetric subcortical structures using `charms` `Labeling.nii.gz ` similar to Freesurfer’s `aseg`. The implementation also provides extensive control over optimization parameters including maximum iterations, population size, and CPU core utilization for performance tuning.
The electrode mapping functionality (`map_to_nearest_net_electrodes()`) implements an optimal assignment algorithm to project unconstrained optimization solutions onto standard EEG montages. The method constructs a Euclidean distance matrix between the optimized electrode positions (extracted from the `posmat` transformation matrices of electrode arrays) and available positions from co-registered EEG nets (loaded from CSV files containing electrode coordinates in subject space). The Hungarian algorithm (via `scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment`) then solves the bipartite matching problem to minimize total assignment distance while ensuring a one-to-one mapping between optimized and standard positions. The mapping preserves the channel-array structure of the original montage and exports results including paired coordinates, electrode labels, and individual mapping distances to facilitate quality assessment. 
**Exhaustive Search Algorithm (`ex-search/ti_sim.py`):** This module relies on a pre-computed leadfield and performs systematic evaluation of all possible electrode combinations based on candidate electrode selection. The `generate_combinations()` function creates a comprehensive set of electrode pair configurations through cartesian product operations, ensuring a logical balance between coverage of the search space and compute efficiency.
The algorithm leverages SimNIBS's `TI_utils.py` module for efficient field calculations. The `load_leadfield()` function retrieves pre-computed electromagnetic field distributions, while `get_field()` calculates the electric field for specific electrode configurations. The temporal interference envelope is computed using the `get_maxTI()` function, which implements the mathematical framework for determining the maximum amplitude of the interference pattern (1). Results are stored as mesh files with associated visualization configurations, enabling immediate inspection in Gmsh as well as a comprehensive .csv file that includes intensity and focality metrics for the user to inspect. 
#### #### 2.3.3 Simulation Engine
The simulation module (`simulator/main-TI.sh`) offers a robust control over simulation parameters which interfaces with SimNIBS's `sim_struct.SESSION` class to configure parameters like anisotropy type (scalar, volume normalized, directional), electrode geometries, and current delivery. 
For TI calculation, the module leverages SimNIBS internal functions to compute individual electric fields for each carrier frequency pair. These fields are then processed through the `TI_utils.get_maxTI()` function, which implements the mathematical framework for calculating the maximum amplitude of the temporal interference envelope at each point in the volume as described by (1).
In addition to TI_max, we compute a surface-aligned normal component (TI_normal) by projecting the local TI vector onto gray-matter surface normals. Both TI_max and TI_normal are exported and analyzed downstream as part of the analyzer tool.
Output management includes generation of both volumetric and surface-mapped results, with automatic conversion to MNI space for group-level analyses. The module creates optimized visualization files compatible with Gmsh and Freeview, facilitating immediate inspection of simulation results in mesh and voxel spaces.
Additionally, the platform implements multi-channel temporal interference capabilities (`simulator/main-mTI.sh`) for configurations involving more than two electrode pairs (multi-polar TI) (25) This extension supports emerging TI paradigms that utilize more than two channels to achieve enhanced spatial selectivity, flexible steering, or multi-target stimulation. 
For reproducibility and batch processing, all electrode montages are saved and loaded from a centralized montage database (`montage_list.json`) that maintains both unipolar and multipolar montage definitions for various EEG cap systems.

#### 2.3.3.1 Simulation Output Structure
The simulation module generates a comprehensive, hierarchically organized output structure that facilitates both immediate analysis and long-term data management. Each simulation produces four primary output directories: `TI/` for temporal interference fields, `high_Frequency/` for carrier frequency analysis, `Analyses/` for region-specific metrics, and `documentation/` for simulation logs and parameters.

**High-Frequency Field Assessment:** The `high_Frequency/` directory contains detailed analysis of the individual carrier fields before interference calculation. Electric field distributions for each carrier frequency pair are exported in both mesh format (`.msh` files viewable in Gmsh) and volumetric NIfTI format (`.nii.gz` files compatible with standard neuroimaging tools). The module computes both vector field components (`E.nii.gz`) and magnitude fields (`magnE.nii.gz`) for each carrier, enabling assessment of field strength and directionality at the kilohertz frequencies. A summary statistics file (`fields_summary.txt`) documents key metrics including mean, maximum, and percentile values for each carrier field within gray matter and user-defined ROIs.

**Temporal Interference Field Exports:** The primary TI fields are exported in multiple formats to support diverse analysis workflows. Mesh outputs include whole-brain TI fields (`*_TI.msh`), tissue-specific extractions for gray and white matter (`grey_*_TI.msh`, `white_*_TI.msh`), and surface-mapped fields on the central cortical surface. For volumetric analysis, NIfTI exports are generated in both native subject space (`*_subject_TI_max.nii.gz`) and normalized MNI space (`*_MNI_TI_max.nii.gz`). The MNI transformation employs SimNIBS's built-in registration to enable group-level analyses while preserving individual field characteristics through nearest-neighbor interpolation.

**Surface Overlays and Projections:** For cortical targets, the module generates surface overlay files (`.central.*` format) compatible with FreeSurfer's visualization tools. These overlays include field magnitude (`.E.magn`), normal component (`.E.normal`), tangential component (`.E.tangent`), and angle relative to surface normal (`.E.angle`) for each hemisphere. This comprehensive surface mapping enables detailed analysis of field-cortex interactions critical for understanding stimulation effects on pyramidal neurons and cortical columns.

**Analysis Integration:** The `Analyses/Mesh/` subdirectory contains region-specific extractions and statistical summaries. For each analyzed ROI, the module generates: extracted mesh regions with field values, CSV files with node-wise field data, histogram visualizations of field distributions, and supplementary metrics including weighted means, maxima, and focality indices. Montage visualizations (`montage_imgs/`) provide anatomical context by highlighting electrode positions and target regions on the head model.

All outputs maintain consistent naming conventions incorporating subject identifiers, target names, and field types, facilitating automated processing in downstream pipelines. The modular output structure supports selective export based on computational resources and research needs, with options to disable specific output types through configuration parameters. 
#### #### 2.3.4 Analysis and Visualization
The analysis module (`analyzer/mesh_analyzer.py`) provides comprehensive tools for quantifying and visualizing TI stimulation outcomes through the `MeshAnalyzer` class. This class implements three primary analysis modes: spherical ROI analysis, cortical region analysis, and whole-head analysis.
The `analyze_sphere()` method enables analysis of spherical regions of interest, utilizing SimNIBS's mesh manipulation functions to extract field values within specified coordinates and radii. For cortical analysis, the `analyze_cortex()` method interfaces with multiple anatomical atlases through SimNIBS's `subject_atlas()` function, supporting Desikan-Killiany, Destrieux, and HCP-MMP1.
A surface mesh generation pipeline implemented through the `_generate_surface_mesh()` method, which calls the `msh2cortex` utility to project volumetric field data onto cortical surfaces. This enables accurate analysis of field distributions in gray matter while accounting for cortical folding patterns.
The `analyze_whole_head()` method performs comprehensive evaluation across all regions in a specified atlas, generating both region-specific analyses and population-level summaries. Field statistics are computed using weighted averaging based on node areas obtained through the `nodes_areas()` function, ensuring accurate representation of field distributions on irregular meshes.
All analyses are done in native subject space to preserve accurate and original simulated field distributions and anatomical boundaries. Operating in subject space circumvents interpolation, resampling, and smoothing artifacts associated with transformations to MNI space, guaranteeing that computed metrics reflect the original simulation outputs.
Visualization capabilities are implemented through the `MeshVisualizer` class (`analyzer/visualizer.py`), which generates multiple output formats including 3D mesh visualizations with customized colormaps (viewable in Gmsh), statistical distribution plots, ROI weighted field distribution histograms, and region-wise scatter plots. The `_generate_region_visualization()` method creates masked field displays highlighting specific anatomical regions, while `_generate_whole_head_plots()` produces summary visualizations for multi-region analyses.
For volumetric analysis, the `VoxelAnalyzer` class (`analyzer/voxel_analyzer.py`) provides complementary functionality for analyzing field distributions in NIfTI format. This includes the `extract_values_from_roi()` method for spherical and atlas-based ROI extraction, and specialized visualization methods for generating slice-based views of field distributions, which can be inspected in Freeview.
Group-level analysis is implemented via the group_analyzer.py script, which enables collection and comparison of TI simulation results across multiple subjects. This module supports high-throughput analysis by generating averaged volumetric field distributions in NIfTI format, producing inter-subject comparison plots, and exporting summary statistics (e.g. mean, max, focality, standard deviations…) across the cohort.  For targeting-based analyses, ROI coordinates are defined in MNI space and automatically transform into each subject’s native space using SimNIBS ‘mni2subject_coords’ method.
All analysis results are automatically exported to CSV format through dedicated save functions, facilitating subsequent statistical analysis and inter-study comparisons. The module maintains comprehensive logging throughout the analysis pipeline, documenting all processing steps and parameter choices for reproducibility.

### 2.4.1 Typical Workflow 
1) Preprocess structural MRI (DICOM→NIfTI, FreeSurfer `recon-all`, SimNIBS `charm`).
2) Define targets (spherical coordinates, atlas labels, or subcortical labels) and optimization goal (ROI mean/max; directional normal; focality). Enable multi-start for stability.
3) Optimize montage (flex-search) or evaluate candidate sets (ex-search). Optionally map free solutions to standard EEG nets.
4) Simulate fields (TI_max, TI_normal; optional anisotropy) and export mesh and NIfTI outputs.
5) Analyze ROI/whole-head on mesh or voxel; export CSVs and plots; review HTML reports; aggregate to MNI for cohort maps.
6) Run group analyses to assess subjects’ exposure and visualize in Gmsh (mesh) and Freeview (NIfTI).
#### 2.4 Standardization and Reproducibility
TI-Toolbox implements a multi-layered approach to ensure complete reproducibility and standardization across clinical research workflows. The platform's logging infrastructure, built on the centralized `logging_util` module, provides consistent formatting and hierarchical logging across all components. The `get_logger()` function creates timestamped log files following the pattern `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] [module_name] [level] message`, ensuring precise tracking of all operations.
The `configure_external_loggers()` function extends this logging consistency to external dependencies including SimNIBS, FreeSurfer, and FSL, redirecting their outputs through the platform's unified logging system. This integration ensures that all processing steps, regardless of their origin, are captured in a single, searchable log file stored in the BIDS-compliant `derivatives/logs/sub-{SUBJECT_ID}/` directory structure.
HTML report generation is managed through the `report_util` module, which provides two specialized generators: `PreprocessingReportGenerator` and `SimulationReportGenerator`. These generators create comprehensive reports that summarize key processes and outcomes similar to fMRIPrep {Citation}, documenting aspects of the pipeline. The `create_preprocessing_report()` function captures structural processing steps, quality metrics, and warning/error logs, while `create_simulation_report()` documents electrode configurations, stimulation parameters, and field calculation results.
The reporting system implements several key features for clinical research, automatic screenshot capture of intermediate processing steps through integration with visualization tools, quality assurance metrics including mesh quality indices, and parameter documentation with version tracking for all software components, and visual summaries of results including field distributions, and electrode placements. See the website’s report wiki page for more information (26). 



### 2.5 Deployment and Infrastructure
### 2.5.1 Docker compose
TI-Toolbox's deployment architecture leverages Docker Compose orchestration to manage a complex ecosystem of neuroimaging tools while ensuring consistent behavior across diverse computing environments. The `docker-compose.yml` configuration defines four primary service containers: Core, Freesurfer, FSL, MRtrix3 all connected through a dedicated bridge network (`tit_network`).
Volume management is handled through named Docker volumes (`tit_fsl`, `tit_freesurfer`, `tit_mrtrix3`) that persist software installations across container restarts, significantly reducing startup times. The `LOCAL_PROJECT_DIR` environment variable enables flexible data mounting, allowing users to process data stored anywhere on their filesystem while maintaining isolation between the host and container environments.
### 2.5.2 Launcher program (Bash / Executable)
The toolbox implements several deployment strategies to accommodate different use cases:
**Desktop Deployment:** The executable launcher (`launcher/executable/`) provides platform-specific binaries created through PyInstaller (27). The executables implement a PyQt5-based  GUI (28,29) that manages Docker daemon connectivity, container lifecycle, and volume mounting. The launcher includes error handling through the `dialogs.py` module, providing user-friendly feedback for common issues such as Docker daemon availability, disk space, and permission errors. The executable requires no system installation after downloading from either the Github release page or the website’s release page (26).
**Server Deployment:** The bash-based launcher (`launcher/bash/loader.sh`) implements a deployment script that handles automatic Docker installation verification and setup, platform-specific volume creation (with special handling for Windows WSL environments), network configuration with automatic port allocation, and container health monitoring and automatic restart policies. The bash entry point provides a solution for headless servers processing. 



#### 2.5.3. Batch Processing and Parallelization
TI-Toolbox implements batch processing and parallelization strategies to enable efficient analysis of large clinical cohorts. The platform's parallelization architecture operates at multiple levels, from individual processing steps to cohort-wide analyses.
**Subject-Level Parallelization:** The preprocessing pipeline (`pre-process/structural.sh`) implements GNU Parallel integration (30) for concurrent processing of multiple subjects. When invoked with the `--parallel` flag, the system automatically detects available CPU cores and distributes subjects across parallel workers. The implementation includes intelligent load balancing through the `parallel` command's built-in job scheduling, with options for real-time progress monitoring (`--progress`), estimated completion times (`--eta`), and immediate failure detection (`--halt now,fail=1`).
**Algorithm-Level Parallelization:** The flex-search optimization module supports multi-core execution through the `--cpus` parameter, which is passed directly to SimNIBS's differential evolution optimizer for faster processing. 
**Pipeline-Level Batch Processing:** The GUI employs multi-threading to keep the interface responsive while long-running jobs execute in background worker threads. A job queue coordinates preprocessing, optimization, simulation, and analysis tasks, with real-time progress reporting, log streaming, and graceful cancellation. This design allows concurrent execution of independent stages across subjects while preserving deterministic logging and outputs.
The platform's batch processing capabilities have been validated on large cohorts, with near-linear scaling up to 32 CPU cores. The modular architecture allows different pipeline stages to execute concurrently, maximizing throughput for large-scale studies.
**TMUX Parallelization:** The code container which is exposed to the user interaction comes with TMUX [https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki] installed which enables further multiplexing where the user can span multiple instances of the toolbox simultaneously. 
**System Monitoring:** To monitor the system during high-demand processes, a designated ‘System Monitor’ tab is available that tracks CPU and memory usage by the toolbox in real time. 
### 2.6 Case Studies
#### 2.6.1 Targets and goals
Using the flex-search, we targeted the left insula to find the best solutions for maximizing the mean TImax in the ROI in round 1, while in round 2 the goal was to maximize the mean TI_normal in the ROI. For the right hippocampus we only search for the best solution that maximizes the mean TImax and for the spherical target we chose to search for maximizing the mean TImax in round 1 and for round 2 we used a multi-objective approach that optimizes the tradeoff between intensity in the ROI and intensity in the non-ROI which we defined as everywhere else in the grey matter (21). 



#### 2.6.2 subjects
We collected magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of thirty-six participants (mean age = 29.9 ± 9.7 years, 58.3% Female) from the STRENGTHEN clinical trial. Participants were excluded if they had any neuroradiologist-identified brain structural abnormalities. All participants gave written informed consent in accordance with the University of Wisconsin-Madison Institutional Review Board. MRI data were collected using a 3 Tesla MAGNUS (Microstructure Anatomy Gradient for Neuroimaging with Ultrafast Scanning, GE Healthcare) head-only MRI scanner. Structural images were acquired using T1- and T2-weighted images, with 0.8 mm isotropic voxels, and the following parameters. T1-weighted: sequence = MP-RAGE (Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient-Echo), repetition time (TR) = 2000 ms, echo time (TE) = 3 ms, inverse time (TI) = 1100 ms, flip angle = 8 degrees, field of view (FOV) = 256 x 256 mm2, matrix size = 320 x 320 pixels, resolution = 0.8 mm x 0.8 mm x 0.8 mm, number of slices = 240, acquisition time = 4 min. T2-weighted: sequence = CUBE-T2, TR  = 2500 ms, TE = 90 ms, echo train length (ETL) = 120, FOV = 256 x 256 mm2, matrix size = 320 x 320 pixels, resolution = 0.8 mm x 0.8 mm x 0.8 mm, number of slices = 240, acquisition time = 4 min. Our 37th participant which serves as our `generalized model` is the publicly available Ernie model (31). 
#### 2.6.3 Flow
Raw DICOM files were preprocessed as in Section 2.3.1. For each target and objective, we ran the flex-search optimizer with the ROI definitions in Section 2.6.1, using a three-run multi-start configuration and retaining the best solution per subject (configurable via Advanced Settings: Number of Optimization Runs). For each participant, we then simulated the resulting montages with default isotropic conductivities (see Supplement), 1 mA per channel, 8 mm electrode diameter, 4mm electrode thickness and Xmm XXXXX. Finally, we applied group analysis to extract TI_max, TI_normal, and focality within ROIs and gray matter.


#### 2.6.4 Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using Python (version 3.8+) with scipy, statsmodels, and pandas libraries. All analyses were performed using a two-tailed significance level of α = 0.05. Data normality was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test, with parametric (paired t-test) or non-parametric (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) approaches selected based on normality test results.
For comparison analyses (Q1 and Q2), paired statistical tests were used to evaluate differences between conditions within subjects. Effect sizes were calculated using Cohen's d for parametric tests and r (Z/√N) for non-parametric tests. Percentage changes were computed as ((B - A) / A) × 100, where A and B represent the two conditions being compared.
For demographic correlation analyses (Q3), Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between TI field metrics and demographic variables (age, bone volume, bone thickness). Multiple linear regression models were constructed to assess the combined predictive value of demographic factors on TI field characteristics. Model fit was evaluated using R² and F-statistics.
## 3. Results

### 3.1 Overview
For the analysis, we investigated temporal interference field characteristics across three distinct brain targets (left insula, right hippocampus, and a spherical ROI) in a cohort of 37 participants. We evaluated both the maximal modulation envelope amplitude (TI_max) and the surface-aligned normal component (TI_normal) to comprehensively characterize field distributions. Statistical comparisons employed paired tests selected based on normality assessments (two-tailed α = 0.05), with effect sizes and percentage changes calculated to evaluate both statistical and practical significance.

### 3.2 Mapping Optimized Solutions to Standard EEG Montages

To assess whether constraining electrode placements to standard HD-EEG positions compromises optimization benefits, we compared field characteristics between freely optimized montages and their mapped counterparts across all three targets. For the left insula, mapping to standard electrode positions resulted in minimal reduction in field intensity, with mean TI_max decreasing from 0.324 V/m to 0.319 V/m (Δ = -0.0043 V/m, -1.35%, p = 0.010). The maximum field values showed similar small reductions from 0.470 V/m to 0.464 V/m (Δ = -0.006 V/m, -1.28%, p = 0.046). Notably, focality remained essentially unchanged (1.410 vs 1.412, p = 0.609), suggesting that spatial selectivity was preserved despite the geometric constraints.

The right hippocampus demonstrated comparable patterns with slightly larger magnitude differences. Mean TI_max values decreased from 0.272 V/m in optimized solutions to 0.256 V/m when mapped (Δ = -0.0154 V/m, -6.00%, p = 0.00352), while maximum values decreased from 0.445 V/m to 0.420 V/m (Δ = -0.025 V/m, -5.62%, p = 0.00391). Interestingly, focality showed a small but statistically significant reduction from 1.349 to 1.307 (-3.21%, p = 0.00435), indicating modest compromise in spatial selectivity for this deeper target.

For the spherical target centered at MNI coordinates (36.10, 14.14, 0.33), mapping effects were intermediate between the two anatomical targets. Mean TI_max decreased from 0.350 V/m to 0.342 V/m (Δ = -0.0079 V/m, -2.31%, p = 2.66×10⁻⁵), with maximum values showing similar reductions from 0.386 V/m to 0.377 V/m (Δ = -0.009 V/m, -2.33%, p = 6.66×10⁻⁵). Focality remained statistically unchanged (1.547 vs 1.555, p = 0.263), reinforcing that electrode mapping preserves targeting precision.

### 3.3 Individualized versus Generalized Head Models

We next examined whether using individualized head models provides meaningful advantages over a generalized template (Ernie model) for TI optimization. For the left insula, individualized models with mapped electrodes achieved higher field intensities than the generalized model, with mean TI_max of 0.319 V/m versus 0.311 V/m (+2.64%, p = 0.000379) and maximum values of 0.464 V/m versus 0.449 V/m (Δ = +0.015 V/m, +3.34%, p = 0.00299). Focality showed no significant difference between approaches (1.412 vs 1.411, p = 0.743).

The right hippocampus revealed an interesting pattern where field intensity metrics were comparable between individualized and generalized models. Mean TI_max values were virtually identical (0.2563 vs 0.2567 V/m, Δ = -0.0004 V/m, -0.16%, p = 0.965), as were maximum values (0.420 vs 0.415 V/m, Δ = +0.005 V/m, +1.20%, p = 0.770). However, the generalized model achieved significantly better focality (1.407 vs 1.307, -7.14%, p = 0.00569), suggesting that for this deep target, the template model may provide more consistent spatial selectivity across the population.

For the spherical target, individualized models showed modest advantages in maximum field values (0.377 vs 0.371 V/m, Δ = +0.006 V/m, +1.62%, p = 0.0411) but not mean values (0.342 vs 0.338 V/m, Δ = +0.004 V/m, +1.18%, p = 0.0638). Notably, individualized models achieved substantially better focality compared to the template (1.555 vs 1.420, +9.53%, p = 8.91×10⁻⁷), indicating superior spatial selectivity when targeting specific coordinate-based regions.

### 3.4 Determinants of Inter-individual Variability

To understand sources of variability in TI field exposure across participants, we examined correlations between field metrics and demographic/anatomical factors. Across all three targets, cortical bone characteristics emerged as the strongest predictors of field intensity. For the left insula, mean TI_max showed strong negative correlations with both cortical bone volume (r = -0.613, p < 0.001) and mean skull thickness (r = -0.561, p < 0.001), with age showing a weaker but significant association (r = -0.196, p = 0.042).

Similar patterns were observed for the right hippocampus, though with somewhat attenuated correlations. Mean TI_max correlated negatively with bone volume (r = -0.402, p < 0.001) and skull thickness (r = -0.352, p < 0.001), while age showed no significant association (p = 0.595). The spherical target displayed intermediate correlation strengths, with bone volume (r = -0.483, p < 0.001) and skull thickness (r = -0.459, p < 0.001) showing robust associations, and age demonstrating a modest negative correlation (r = -0.242, p = 0.012).

Multiple regression models incorporating all three predictors (age, bone volume, skull thickness) explained substantial but varying proportions of variance across targets. The left insula model achieved the highest explanatory power (R² = 0.387, F = 21.91, p < 0.001), followed by the spherical target (R² = 0.266, F = 12.55, p < 0.001), while the right hippocampus showed the lowest predictability (R² = 0.162, F = 6.68, p < 0.001). These findings indicate that while bone morphology consistently influences TI field penetration, additional unmeasured factors contribute to inter-individual variability, particularly for deeper targets.

### 3.5 Surface-Aligned Field Components

Given the importance of field orientation relative to cortical geometry, we analyzed the normal component of TI fields (TI_normal) for cortical targets. Comparing mapped to optimized montages for the left insula, mean TI_normal decreased from 0.226 V/m to 0.216 V/m (Δ = -0.0096 V/m, -4.43%, p = 2.96×10⁻⁹), with maximum values showing similar reductions from 0.402 V/m to 0.394 V/m (Δ = -0.008 V/m, -1.99%, p = 0.0157). Normal focality remained statistically unchanged (2.265 vs 2.244, p = 0.117), suggesting preserved directional selectivity despite electrode constraints.

The spherical target showed comparable sensitivity of the normal component to electrode mapping, with mean values decreasing from 0.201 V/m to 0.192 V/m (Δ = -0.0094 V/m, -4.89%, p = 5.22×10⁻⁶) and maximum values from 0.351 V/m to 0.343 V/m (Δ = -0.008 V/m, -2.28%, p = 0.00412). Normal focality showed a trend toward reduction that did not reach significance (2.025 vs 1.983, p = 0.0681).

When comparing individualized mapped montages to the generalized model, the left insula showed no difference in mean TI_normal (0.216 V/m for both, p = 0.905), though individualized models achieved higher maximum values (0.394 vs 0.381 V/m, Δ = +0.013 V/m, +3.41%, p = 0.0181) at the cost of reduced focality (2.244 vs 2.342, -4.20%, p = 0.000112). The spherical target demonstrated more pronounced differences, with individualized models showing lower mean TI_normal (0.192 vs 0.220 V/m, -12.75%, p = 0.000153) but higher maximum values (0.343 vs 0.331 V/m, +3.65%, p = 0.000175) and substantially reduced focality (1.983 vs 2.296, -13.61%, p = 0.000302). These results suggest that while the normal component provides additional insight into field-tissue interactions, it does not demonstrate superior sensitivity to methodological choices compared to TI_max.

## 4. Discussion
### 4.1 TI-Toolbox: strengths and the gap it closes
TI-Toolbox unifies the end-to-end TI workflow—from DICOM preprocessing and head-model generation through montage optimization, field simulation, analysis, and visualization —under a single, containerized framework with both GUI and CLI access. The platform lowers technical barriers, promotes standardized outputs and reports, and enables reproducible, cohort-scale studies. Beyond orchestration, it adds TI-specific capabilities that close long-standing gaps: electrode mapping from free solutions to standard HD-EEG nets, support for multiple optimization goals (intensity and focality) (22), and computation of both TI_max and grey matter surface-aligned TI_normal. It follows best practices when it comes to BIDS project directory structure (27) and group analysis in subject space with optional MNI exports.
### 4.2 Related and competing software
Open-source tools such as SimNIBS (33), ROAST (34), and COMETS2 (35) provide critical components for conventional tES but are not purpose-built for TI workflows and often require advanced scripting to assemble multi-stage pipelines. Commercial options like the TI Planning Tool (36) and HD-Targets-IFS (37) offers advanced TI-specific features yet are closed-source and can be cost-prohibitive or operationally constrained. TI-Toolbox complements this ecosystem by integrating established neuroimaging tools with TI-focused algorithms and automation, providing an accessible, transparent, and reproducible solution that is directly aligned with translational and clinical research needs.
### 4.3 Case studies: summary and interpretation

Our case studies reveal several important insights for the practical implementation of TI stimulation. While many of our comparisons reached statistical significance, it is crucial to distinguish between statistical and clinical relevance. The cohort-level mean percentage differences in ROI intensity were typically small, ranging from approximately 1–6%, and in isolation are unlikely to be clinically meaningful. This finding emphasizes that researchers should carefully consider effect sizes alongside p-values when interpreting TI simulation results.

The validity of electrode mapping emerged as a particularly encouraging finding for clinical translation. When we mapped unconstrained genetic optimization solutions to standard HD-EEG net positions, the resulting montages preserved both intensity and focality characteristics without substantially impairing optimization benefits. This preservation of field characteristics suggests that mapping offers a practical route to montage standardization and smoother clinical translation, eliminating the need for specialized neuronavigation devices while maintaining targeting efficacy. The successful mapping validates the use of pre-manufactured electrode arrays in clinical settings, potentially reducing both cost and complexity of TI implementation.

Our comparison between individualized and generalized head models revealed a nuanced picture of when each approach is most appropriate. The generalized head model proved adequate for discovering effective electrode configurations for both cortical and subcortical targets, suggesting that initial montage design and optimization can proceed without individual MRI scans. However, accurate exposure assessment clearly requires individualized models due to the substantial inter-individual variability observed in our cohort. This finding supports a hybrid workflow where generalized models guide initial protocol development, while individualized models enable precise dose determination and safety assessment for clinical applications. It is important to note that our analysis assumes quasi-uniform field distributions within ROIs when computing mean values, while in reality the fields exhibit spatial gradients and hotspots that may have differential physiological effects depending on the specific neural circuits engaged.

The analysis of inter-individual variability sources provided mechanistic insights into TI field propagation through biological tissues. Bone morphology emerged as a dominant factor, with strong negative associations between cortical bone volume/skull thickness and ROI field strength observed consistently across all targets. While these anatomical factors explained up to 38.7% of variance for cortical targets, substantial unexplained variance remains, indicating that additional anatomical and demographic contributors influence field distributions. This partial predictability underscores the importance of individualized modeling for precise exposure assessment, particularly when relating stimulation parameters to clinical outcomes.

Finally, our evaluation of surface-aligned field components addressed an important consideration for cortical stimulation. The normal component of TI fields (TI_normal) provides insight into field-tissue interactions that may be particularly relevant for pyramidal neurons oriented perpendicular to the cortical surface. However, in our analyses, TI_normal did not demonstrate superior sensitivity to methodological choices compared to TI_max when evaluating mapping effects or model individualization. Nevertheless, we recommend reporting both metrics for completeness, as the physiological relevance of field directionality remains an active area of investigation in the TI literature.
### 4.4 Limitations
Several limitations warrant consideration when interpreting our findings. First, our cohort size (n = 37) and relatively narrow age range (mean 29.9 ± 9.7 years) may limit generalizability across the lifespan. Previous research indicated significant X correlation between age to intensity of TES exposure.  Second, our simulations employed isotropic conductivity values and did not leverage diffusion-derived anisotropy [REF], which could influence field exposure.
Third, all electromagnetic field calculations relied on the quasi-static approximation, which assumes that propagation and inductive effects are negligible at the frequencies employed in TI stimulation (typically 1-10 kHz carriers). While this approximation is widely accepted for conventional tES and has been validated for frequencies up to several kilohertz in biological tissues, the validity at TI carrier frequencies warrants continued investigation, particularly given recent discussions about potential high-frequency effects [REF] and the complex interaction between multiple electric fields at different frequencies [REF].

Fourth, our electrode mapping approach, while successful in preserving field characteristics, was evaluated using only the inner 185 electrodes of the GSN-HydroCel-256 system (EGI/Philips). This high-density array provides approximately 2-3 cm inter-electrode spacing, which may represent an upper bound for successful mapping resolution. The minimum electrode density required for accurate mapping of optimized TI montages remains unexplored, and future work should systematically evaluate how mapping fidelity degrades with decreasing electrode density, particularly for standard 10-20 or 10-10 systems with larger inter-electrode distances.

Finally, while our bone analyzer module successfully identified cortical bone morphology as a major determinant of inter-individual variability in TI exposure, explaining up to 38.7% of variance for cortical targets, substantial unexplained variance remains. The bone analyzer itself represents an experimental tool that, while providing consistent measurements across our cohort, has not been independently validated against ground-truth measurements from high-resolution CT imaging [REF] or other purposed methods [REF]. Future work should validate these measurements and investigate additional anatomical contributors to variability, including CSF volume and distribution, and scalp thickness.


### 4.5 Implications and future directions

The development and validation of TI-Toolbox carries several important implications for the broader TI research community. As an open-source platform, the toolbox provides an opportunity for collaborative advancement of TI methodologies. We encourage researchers to not only utilize the platform but also to scrutinize its implementations, contribute improvements, and share validated workflows. This community-driven approach will be essential for establishing standardized protocols and accelerating the development of interoperable tools across different research groups and clinical centers.

Our findings also inform best practices for clinical implementation of TI stimulation. The evidence suggests that prospective clinical studies should adopt a tiered approach to modeling complexity. While generalized head models can effectively guide initial montage design and protocol development, individualized models become crucial when relating exposure to electrophysiological and behavioral outcomes. This distinction is particularly important for dose-response studies and for understanding inter-individual variability in treatment response. The substantial variance in field exposure across individuals, even with identical montages, underscores the necessity of subject-specific modeling for precision medicine applications.

Regarding field assessment metrics, our analyses support comprehensive reporting strategies that capture multiple aspects of TI stimulation. We recommend that researchers report both TI_max and TI_normal for cortical targets, as these metrics provide complementary information about field intensity and directionality. While TI_max remains the primary metric for overall exposure assessment, TI_normal may prove particularly relevant for understanding interactions with columnar cortical organization. Future work should investigate the differential physiological relevance of these metrics across different brain regions and cell types.

Finally, our experience with optimization algorithms suggests that hybrid workflows may offer the best balance between computational efficiency and solution quality. A strategy combining genetic search for initial exploration with targeted exhaustive evaluation of promising regions can yield robust, clinically actionable montages while maintaining reasonable computational demands. This approach becomes particularly valuable when optimizing for multiple objectives or when targeting multiple brain regions simultaneously. As computational resources continue to improve, we anticipate that more sophisticated optimization strategies, potentially incorporating machine learning approaches, will further enhance targeting precision and clinical applicability.

### 4.6 Concluding remarks
Taken together, the case studies support a pragmatic translational pathway: use standardized mapping for clinical usability, leverage a generalized model to prototype montages, and rely on individualized models for exposure quantification and safety assessment. TI-Toolbox operationalizes this pathway within a reproducible, open, and extensible framework, laying the groundwork for multi-center harmonization and prospective validation.
## 5. Conclusions
TI-Toolbox provides an integrated, validated, and accessible platform for TI research. The emphasis on reproducibility, standardization, and accessibility positions TI-Toolbox to accelerate scientific discovery and clinical translation in non-invasive deep brain stimulation. We anticipate that TI-Toolbox will catalyze collaborative development, enabling the community to establish standardized protocols, share validated workflows, and advance the field toward clinical applications.

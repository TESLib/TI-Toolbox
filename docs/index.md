## What is Temporal Interference?

Temporal Interference (TI) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that uses multiple high-frequency electric fields to create a low-frequency envelope at their intersection point. This allows for deep brain stimulation without affecting superficial tissues.

## Key Features

- **BIDS-compliant**: Works with Brain Imaging Data Structure formatted datasets
- **Multi-platform**: Runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- **GPU Support**: Accelerated processing for compatible systems
- **Extensible**: Modular architecture allows for custom extensions
- **Open Source**: Free and open for research use

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: macOS 10.14+, Ubuntu 18.04+, Windows 10+
- **Docker Desktop**: Latest version required
- **RAM**: Minimum 16GB (32GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 50GB free space for Docker images
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (optional, for acceleration)

## Latest Release

**Version 2.1.4** - Released May 2025

Major update with improved Docker integration, new GUI launcher, and enhanced optimization algorithms.

# About Temporal Interference Toolbox

The Temporal Interference Toolbox is an open-source platform for advanced brain stimulation research, offering a comprehensive pipeline for temporal interference (TI) stimulation, from neuroimaging to simulation and analysis.

## Key Features

- **BIDS-compliant**: Organize your data using the Brain Imaging Data Structure
- **Pre-processing**: DICOM to NIfTI, FreeSurfer, SimNIBS head modeling
- **Optimization**: flex-search (evolutionary) and ex-search (exhaustive) algorithms
- **Simulation**: FEM-based TI/mTI field solvers
- **Analysis**: ROI and atlas-based tools
- **Visualization**: NIfTI/mesh viewers, report generator
- **Docker-based**: Fully containerized for reproducibility and easy deployment

## Workflow Overview

A typical workflow involves data preparation in BIDS format, pre-processing, electrode optimization, TI field simulation, and subsequent analysis and visualization. For a detailed workflow, please see the [Documentation](/documentation) or [Wiki](/wiki).

# About Temporal Interference Toolbox

The Temporal Interference Toolbox is an open-source platform for advanced brain stimulation research. It provides a complete pipeline for temporal interference (TI) stimulation, from raw neuroimaging data to simulation, optimization, analysis, and visualization.

## Key Features

- **BIDS-compliant**: Organize your data using the Brain Imaging Data Structure
- **Pre-processing**: DICOM to NIfTI, FreeSurfer, SimNIBS head modeling
- **Optimization**: flex-search (evolutionary) and ex-search (exhaustive) algorithms
- **Simulation**: FEM-based TI/mTI field solvers
- **Analysis**: ROI and atlas-based tools
- **Visualization**: NIfTI/mesh viewers, report generator
- **Docker-based**: Fully containerized for reproducibility and easy deployment

## Workflow Overview

1. Set up your BIDS project directory
2. Install Docker Desktop
3. Download the latest release from the [releases page](/releases)
4. Pre-process your data
5. Optimize electrode placement
6. Simulate TI fields
7. Analyze and visualize results

For more details, see the [documentation](/documentation) or [wiki](/wiki).

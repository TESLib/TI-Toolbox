# About Temporal Interference Toolbox

## Our Mission

Temporal Interference Toolbox (Temporal Interference Toolbox) is an open-source toolbox designed to advance research in non-invasive brain stimulation through temporal interference. Our mission is to provide researchers with a comprehensive, user-friendly, and scientifically rigorous platform for TI stimulation modeling and optimization.

## What We Do

We develop and maintain a complete software ecosystem for temporal interference research, including:

- **Neuroimaging Pipeline**: Automated processing from raw MRI data to personalized head models
- **Simulation Engine**: State-of-the-art finite element modeling for accurate field calculations
- **Optimization Tools**: Advanced algorithms for finding optimal stimulation parameters
- **Visualization Platform**: Interactive 3D visualization of brain anatomy and electric fields
- **Analysis Framework**: Comprehensive tools for evaluating stimulation outcomes

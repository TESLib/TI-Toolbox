🎨 Colors
Use color with purpose:

✅ Green: Success, confirmation (e.g., “Save” or “Success”).

❌ Red: Errors, destructive actions (e.g., “Delete”, warnings).

ℹ️ Blue: Primary actions, links, trust (e.g., “Submit”).

⚠️ Yellow/Orange: Warnings, caution.

Avoid relying on color alone to convey meaning (for accessibility).

Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background.

🟦 Buttons
Use consistent styles for:

Primary actions: Bold colors (usually blue).

Secondary actions: Muted colors (gray or outlined).

Destructive actions: Red, clearly marked.

Ensure button size is large enough to click/tap comfortably.

Include icon + label when helpful (e.g., 🗑️ Delete).

✨ States (Feedback & Interaction)
Normal: Default look.

Hover: Visual cue like highlight, shadow, or color change to show it’s clickable.

Focus: Keyboard tabbing should show focus with outlines or glow.

Pressed/Active: Indicates a button is being clicked/tapped.

Disabled: Grayed out, non-interactive state.

Loading: Spinner or animation on click to indicate background activity.

Success/Error: After action, show confirmation or error feedback (toast, dialog, etc.).

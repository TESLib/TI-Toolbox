### v2.1.0 (Latest Release)

**Release Date**: August 25, 2025

#### Additions
- **Improved BIDS formatting:** Enhanced Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) compliance and formatting for better data - organization and compatibility
- **Debug mode for console output:** Introduced comprehensive debug mode with detailed console logging for troubleshooting and development
- **Inter-individual variability assessment:** New bone analyzer tool integrated into pre-processing pipeline for assessing anatomical variations between subjects
- **Multi-start approach for flex-search optimization:** Implemented multi-start optimization strategy to counter local maxima issues in electrode placement optimization

#### Fixes
- **Removed MATLAB runtime dependency:** Eliminated MATLAB runtime requirement, making the toolbox fully independent and easier to deploy
- **mTI bug fixes and upstream integration:** Resolved critical bugs in mTI (multi-channel Temporal Interference) functionality and improved integration with upstream SimNIBS components
- **Enhanced X11 handling for macOS:** Improved X11 server integration and display management for better GUI - functionality on macOS systems
- **Official rebranding:** Complete renaming from TI-CSC to TI-Toolbox across all components, documentation, and user interfaces
